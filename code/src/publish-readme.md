## Plexdata Settings Serialization

The _Plexdata Settings Serialization_ represents an alternative to the standard settings serialization mechanism.

Main feature of this library is that users are able to define the path as well as the extension of their settings file.

As extension to the standard settings handling, this library allows to put the settings into the directory of the executable. 
This is very interesting for so called _Portable Apps_, which usually manage all their data within one and the same directory.

Another feature of this library is the possibility to control the format of the settings file. At the moment, reading and 
writing of settings files in JSON format as well as in XML format is supported. Other formats like for example _old-school_ 
INI files may follow in a later version.

### Framework
